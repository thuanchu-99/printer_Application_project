## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### C (Firmware Layer)
- Runs directly on the printer‚Äôs control board.  
- Manages low-level drivers: motor, printhead, scanner, paper sensors, Ethernet/WiFi.  
- Communicates with control chips via SPI/I¬≤C/UART.  
- Provides basic APIs for the upper backend layer (C++).  
- Also used to **define and handle network protocols**: TCP/IP, SMTP (email), FTP, SMB, IPP (network printing), SNMP (device monitoring).

### C# (Driver Layer)
- Builds printer drivers for Windows/Linux/Mac.  
- Manages standard communication (IPP, LPR, SMB, USB).  
- Provides small UI dialogs for selecting paper size, print resolution, print mode.  
- Built on **.NET Framework / .NET Core** for OS integration.

### C++ with Qt + Backend
- Qt: builds the touchscreen UI on the printer device.  
- C++ backend: handles system logic such as user management, job queue, authentication, scan-to-email, fax.  
- Integrates network protocols at a higher level (via APIs from the C layer).  
- Uses multithreading, memory management, and IPC to manage concurrent tasks.

### JavaScript (Web Admin)
- Builds the **web-based administration panel** for IT admins.  
- Enables system configuration: ports, SMTP, user accounts, marketplace apps.  
- Communicates with the C++ backend through REST APIs.  
- Runs on an **embedded web server** (Nginx/lighttpd) inside the printer.

### Python & Node.js (Supporting Tools)
- **Python**: used for automation scripts, test frameworks, data parsing, log analysis, and maintenance tools.  
- **Node.js**: used for building auxiliary web services, integration testing, and lightweight microservices to extend system capabilities.  
- These supporting languages help accelerate development and provide better tooling for QA, DevOps, and system integration.

## üîí Confidentiality Note

This README only provides a **high-level overview** of the project for demonstration and presentation purposes.  
The actual project is **much more complex** and contains details that cannot be shared publicly due to **customer confidentiality policies**.
